# Pre-release and Experimental Builds

New features are usually developed on a separate branch of the project until they are ready to be merged into the current beta release. In most cases you can download builds of these branches and try them out yourself.

**In the sidebar to the left** we list the major alternative versions that are currently available, explain their features and what state they are currently in.&#x20;

Some features are might spend months or years as separate builds. The person who started them might have got too busy to continue the work or they might just not be suitable in their current state. In most cases we will attempt to keep them up to date with the main release so they will have all the current beta release features _as well as_ the extra things they bring to the table.

## Beta Release

{% endcontent-ref %}

Whenever any new change is added to Open Brush, before it's released to the various stores and sites, there is an engineering "pre-release" version available. If you'd like to help beta test new versions, you can get these builds as soon as the new code is added (generally within 20 minutes!). Windows (SteamVR) and Quest/Quest 2 versions are built automatically which you can get from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/icosa-foundation/open-brush/releases). Versions of the form "vX.Y.0" are official releases, whereas versions that do not end in .0 are made available for testing purposes only, with no guarantees as to their quality.

These builds share a save location with the official Open Brush release, but can be installed alongside the formal version. The Oculus build, like all sideloaded content, will be listed in "Unknown Sources", and will have the word "Github" appended to the name (with a different package name as well) to differentiate it from the official release).

## "Experimental Mode" Build

Whilst Open Brush was still Tilt Brush, the original team had a bunch of features and brushes they felt weren't quite ready to be released in the official app. As soon as Tilt Brush was made open source, everyone immediately leapt on these features with great excitement.

## Feature Builds

Generally - when someone is working on a new feature, they create a new build to work on until the features is ready to merge back into the main release.

You can download these builds to try out new features. Sometimes the sketches you create with these builds won't open correctly in the main release (but not always) and like all pre-release versions these builds might contain bugs or incomplete features.

## Multibrush (Tilt Brush fork)

Multibrush is mostly an [experimental mode build](main-experimental-build.md) with two extra features:

1\. Post-processing effects that change the appearance of your entire scene.\
2\. Multiuser support: multiple people can paint at the same time and use voice chat in realtime.

Multibrush does not currently include most of the features that we have added to Open Brush since release.

## Full list of known Work in Progress

There's more features that are being worked on that listed above. We've omitted them because they are either too incomplete for users to try out or they have put on hold for some reason (usually that we're too busy to finish them at the moment!)

Here's the complete list that contains many items above plus a few more!

(If you can help out with any of these - please get in touch!)
