### What does it do?

Tilt Brush was previously tightly integrated with [Google Poly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_\(website\)) - a website for publishing, sharing and browsing 3D models and Tilt Brush Sketches. This was both an easy way to allow others to view your work and a resource to find 3d elements that you can use to build your scene. It made it easy to produce sketches that combined elements drawn in with brushes in Tilt Brush with low-poly models created in Blocks.

We've created the [Icosa Gallery](https://icosa.gallery/) - a replacement for the Google Poly website and restored all the publically shared artwork that was saved from the shutdown of Poly by volunteers from [Archive Team](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/) and other groups. We've also restored and even improved upon the integration with Open Brush and Blocks and have integration planned with Blender, Godot and other 3d apps and platforms.

### How do I install it?

Download a build for your headset from the link above and unzip it. You can run the Windows exe directly. To install the Quest apk use SideQuest: [https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/](https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/)
