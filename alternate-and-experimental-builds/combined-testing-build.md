# Combined Testing Build

To make trying out multiple features easier I maintain a "Kitchen Sink" build that combines multiple feature builds in one. Sometimes these features might not work perfectly in combination and this build probably gets tested less than the individual feature builds.

If you're using this build and find a bug, it would be really helpful if you could check to see if that bug also appears on the relevant single feature build.

Currently this build combines all the features in the [beta release](../automatic-release-notes/automatic-changelog.md) plus the following features:

* [3D Shapes](3d-shapes.md)
* [Plugin Scripting](runtime-scripting/)
