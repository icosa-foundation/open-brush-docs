# Andybak's Experimental Builds

Note - I'm maintaining each feature as a separate build as some are probably more viable to merge into the official Open Brush than others (or at least - will be viable sooner).

~~However - if you want the kitchen sink version with everything included you can download an~~ [~~integration build~~](https://github.com/IxxyXR/open-brush/wiki/Downloads) ~~and test out all the features together~~

~~That contains all the features mentioned below. In some cases they might intefere with each other to some degree but I'll fix those issues as soon as I spot them.~~

(currently I'm not keeping the integration build up to date. I'll do that again soon)

On to the features...

## Current Feature Builds

[more info and download](polyhedra-and-symmetry.md)

This is basically my other project Polyhydra ( [https://andybak.net/polyhydra](https://andybak.net/polyhydra) ) smushed together with Tilt Brush. Create a wide range of geometric forms and use them as the basis for complex mirroring of your brush strokes.
