### What does it do?

It randomly changes the color by a set amount every time you paint a stroke

### What's it good for?

Adding some natural variation across multiple brush strokes

### How do I install it?

Download a build for your headset from the link above and unzip it. You can run the Windows exe directly. To install the Quest apk use SideQuest: [https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/](https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/)

### How do I use it?

There's a new button on the colour picker that opens up a panel where you can set how much variation to add per stroke \(1 slider each for hue, saturation and value jitter\)

### Known Issues

I've had to make the color preset buttons slightly smaller and closer together. It can be fiddly deleting a preset \(but to be fair - it was before as well\)

## How do I get help

Come over to the Open Brush Discord: [https://discord.openbrush.app](https://discord.openbrush.app) and chat to me \( andybak\#5425 \).

I'm on UK time \(currently UTC+1\) but I check in fairly regularly.

### Can I see it in action?
