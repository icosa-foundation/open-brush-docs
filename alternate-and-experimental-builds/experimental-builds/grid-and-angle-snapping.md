# Grid and Angle Snapping

#### Status: Part of the current [1.0 beta release](../../readme/open-brush-beta-docs.md)

### What does it do?

![TODO](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804251582715265034/846812293177933894/2021-05-25\_19-06-31.gif)

1. Snap selections to a grid. Duplicate selections at precise positions
2. Draw brush strokes that align with the grid (especially useful with the hull brush)
3. Snap the rotation of selections to a chosen angle (i.e. 15, 45 or 90 degrees)

### What's it good for?

Drawing along straight x, y or z lines. Building regular structures up by making multiple copies of brush strokes

### How do I install it?

Download a build for your headset from the link above and unzip it. You can run the Windows exe directly. To install the Quest apk use SideQuest: [https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/](https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/)

### How do I use it?

Click the new button on the Labs panel to open the new Snap Settings panel

### Known Issues

1. Angle snapping can feel a bit fiddly but gets easier when you get a feel for it.
2. The preview grid for position snapping sometimes appears too far from your controller.
3. There's no control over the point that a selection uses as it's snap point (it's always the center of the selection). Ideally you'd be able to pick top, bottom, front, back etc.
4. Similarly, the center of rotation is always the selection center.

## How do I get help
