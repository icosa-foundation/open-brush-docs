# "Experimental Mode" Builds

{% hint style="info" %}
This page is outdated. There is no longer a separate build for this mode. The current release combines "normal" and "experimental" builds into one. You can simply flip a toggle in the settings and restart the app. See the docs on [Experimental Mode](../user-guide/experimental-mode.md)

However - there are still plenty of interesting [Experimental Builds](./) to try!
{% endhint %}
