### What does it do?

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/VxVjkV_CkFs" %}

Big expansion to the mirror to support many different types of symmetry:

**Point Symmetry:** Symmetry around a point. 7 familiies of axial symmetry plus 3 (soon to be 7) unique polyhedral symmetries.

**Wallpaper Symmetry:** 17 types of tiling symmetry

### What's it good for?

Creating symmetrical patterns from your brush strokes.

### How do I install it?

Download a build for your headset from the link above and unzip it. You can run the Windows exe directly. To install the Quest apk use SideQuest: [https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/](https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/)

### How do I use it?

Long press the mirror button on the Experimental Panel:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

This will bring up the Symmetry settings panel which contains three tabs:

#### Point Symmetry

#### Wallpaper Symmetry

#### Options

### Known Issues&#x20;

1. Not all brushes work. Flat brushes are missing whenever the symmetry is mirrored (you might see half the number of copies you were expecting. Most tube-like brushes work
2. Wallpaper symmetry doesn't scale properly with the canvas
3. Wallpaper symmetry is not centered on the Mirror widget
4. Wallpaper symmetry sometimes transforms the stroke you're drawing. This is a bit confusing but it's possible to work with.

## How do I get help

Come over to the Open Brush Discord: [https://discord.com/invite/fS69VdFXpk](https://discord.com/invite/fS69VdFXpk) and chat to me ( andybak#5425 ).

I'm on UK time but I check in fairly regularly.
