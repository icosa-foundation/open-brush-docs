&#x20;This is in the [current beta release](open-brush-beta-docs.md).

### What does it do?

Social painting. Create with others.

### What's it good for?

Collaborate on a sketch or invite people to watch you create.

### How do I install it?

Download a build for your headset from the link above and unzip it. You can run the Windows exe directly. To install the Quest apk use SideQuest: [https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/](https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/)

### How do I use it?

There's a new button on the main admin panel. You enter a room name of your choice (or accept the random one provided). Share that room name with anyone you want to join.

### Known Issues and current limitations

* Undo is disabled when in multiplayer mode.
* Loading sketches is disabled in multiplayer mode
* You must switch to [basic mode](../user-guide/using-the-open-brush-tools-quick-tools-and-menu-panels/tool-panels.md) before joining a room. Currently only basic mode features are supported.
* People that join the room will see the strokes you have made this session but they won't see any strokes that you loaded from saved sketch.

Our next priority is to fix the last issue. After that we will probably release the multiplayer functionality into the main beta release so it's easier for people to try it out. However - the more testing and feedback we can get at this stage, the better the beta release will be so please try out this build.

## How do I get help

Come over to the [Open Brush Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fS69VdFXpk) and chat to Riccardo ( @sbanca ) or me ( @andybak#5425 ). We're both on UK time.

### Can I see it in action?
