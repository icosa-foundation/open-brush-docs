# Old or Completed Feature Builds

Generally - when someone is working on a new feature, they create a new build to work on until the features is ready to merge back into the main release.

You can download these builds to try out new features. Sometimes the sketches you create with these builds won't open correctly in the main release (but not always) and like all pre-release versions these builds might contain bugs or incomplete features.\
