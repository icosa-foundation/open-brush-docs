# Insominx's (michael-g) Experimental Build

**Note: Released in** [**v1.0**](broken-reference)

This build was intended to streamline the UI with a subset of features to:

1. Not overwhelm the user with complexity.  This essentially meant that it should look as similar to basic mode as possible. &#x20;
2. Contain only features deemed useful for classroom-style usage.  This includes filtering the brushes down and rearranging several tools found in various panels into a single panel.&#x20;

Both #1 and #2 were accomplished by creating a new "classroom" panel mode in addition to the normal "basic" and "advanced".

This build was successfully utilized to teach aspects of raytracing as show in the video below and its git repository can be found [here](https://github.com/insominx/open-brush).
