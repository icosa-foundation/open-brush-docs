### What does it do?

Organize your sketch into layers that can be turned on and off separately. Exports use only the layers you've set as visible so you can create layer just for guides strokes or construction lines.

### How do I install it?

Download a build for your headset from the link above and unzip it. You can run the Windows exe directly. To install the Quest apk use SideQuest: [https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to](https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/)
