# Feature: New Monoscopic Mode

{% hint style="info" %}
At the time of writing - the current [beta version](../open-brush-beta-docs.md) has added a new [View Sketches mode and has made Monoscopic Mode available](../../user-guide/monoscopic-mode.md) without needing to download a separate version of Open Brush. This is probably the direction we will be taking - rather than directly incorporating Rapka's work.
{% endhint %}

User @rapka on Github (@collige on the Discord) is working on a new, revamped version of the existing [Monoscopic Mode](../../developer-notes/github-wiki/monoscopicmode.md) - the mode that allows you to use Open Brush without VR using keyboard and mouse. It's still not quite ready but it's more intuitive than the existing monoscopic mode and uses the WASD keyboard controls familiar to anyone who is used to standard PC game controls.
