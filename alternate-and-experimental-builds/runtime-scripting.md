### What does it do?

Unlike the existing OpenBrush API, runtime scripting is designed to run small scripts that directly modify
the behaviour of various features while you are actually using them. For example a script might move the
pointer as you are painting or add new strokes in response to your actions.

### What's it good for?

Changing the way Open Brush responds to user actions. Adding new mirror modes or creating a new custom brush tool.

### How do I install it?

Download a build for your headset from the link above and unzip it. You can run the Windows exe directly. To install the Quest apk use SideQuest: [https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/](https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/)

### How do I use it?

There's a new button on the Experimental Features panel that opens the Brush Editing panel. Select a brush and then click the button to create an editable duplicate. (at the moment you have to scroll to the end of the Brushes panel to select the new brush but this should happen automatically)

### Known Issues

Lots. It's an early proof of concept

## How do I get help

Come over to the [Open Brush Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fS69VdFXpk) and chat to me ( @andybak#5425 ). I'm on UK time (currently UTC+1) but I check in fairly regularly.

### Can I see it in action?

Not yet.
