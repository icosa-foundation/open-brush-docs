# Example Background Plugins

### AutoSpinSymmetry

Allows you to precisely control the spin speed of the symmetry widget

### CrossfadeLayers

Cycles through all layers, fading one out as the next one fades in. An example of using shader parameters to fade strokes in and out

### DrawAndAnimateStrokes

An example of drawing procedurally on startup and then using shader parameters to animate the strokes it has created

### Lines

An example of drawing continuously. It draws random straight lines for as long as the script is active.

### RandomPanorama

Randomly downloads a panorama from Openverse and sets it as the current skybox. Not every skybox is valid so you might need to toggle the script a few times. Also - they are quite large files. If you're short of space - make sure you have a clear out occasionally!
