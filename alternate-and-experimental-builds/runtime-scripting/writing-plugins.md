# Writing Plugins

Plugins are written in the scripting language [Lua](https://www.lua.org) which is designed to be simple to learn and easy to understand. There's plenty of tutorials online and Lua is widely used in games and applications such as Factorio, Garry's Mod_,_ Roblox, [LÃ–VR](https://lovr.org/) and many others.

If you've written scripts in any other language then you'll find it easy to pick up.&#x20;

If you've never programmed at all then Lua is a great place to start. Copy an example script to your Open Brush folder (there's a button next to each Plugin type that does this for you), open it up in a text editor and try changing things.

As soon as you save your changes, Open Brush will load the new version. If you've made a mistake then the console on the back of your brush hand will tell you what line the error is on.
