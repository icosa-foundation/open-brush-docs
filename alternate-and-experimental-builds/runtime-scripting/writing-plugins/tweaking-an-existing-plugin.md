# Tweaking existing plugins

A great way to get comfortable with how plugin scripting works - especially if you've never coded before - is to look at existing scripts and modify how they work on small (or not so small) ways.

Any of the example plugins can be copied to your Open Brush plugins folder simply by clicking the copy button for that plugin type: <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="" data-size="line">

(If this button isn't visible then a script of that name already exists in your plugins folder - you've probably already clicked the button for that particular plugin).

Once a plugin script does exist in your plugins folder you can edit it. Any changes you make will take effect immediately - there's no need to restart either Open Brush or the plugin itself. Any syntax errors might stop the plugin working. If so these are displayed on the console on the back of your brush controller. They will tell you which script and which line number has the problem.
