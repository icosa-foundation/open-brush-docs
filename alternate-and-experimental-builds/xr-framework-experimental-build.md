# XR Framework Experimental Build

This will enable us to keep up to date with new features that are only available with modern VR SDKs such as hand tracking, passthrough. In addition it will make it much easier to support new platforms and devices moving forward.

As this is mainly of interest to developers wanting to port Open Brush to new hardware or newer versions of Unity, it's best to start with the branch on Github: [https://github.com/icosa-gallery/open-brush/tree/feature/xr\_v2](https://github.com/icosa-gallery/open-brush/tree/feature/xr\_v2)
