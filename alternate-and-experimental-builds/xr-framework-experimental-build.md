# ðŸš€ XR Framework Beta

We have been hard at work updating Open Brush to the latest version of Unity and it's new XR Framework. This will enable us to keep up to date with new features that are only available with modern VR SDKs such as hand tracking and passthrough. In addition it will make it much easier to support new platforms and devices moving forward.

As this is a big fundamental change in how Open Brush interacts with devices, we need your help testing our new builds before we release it generally.

### I want to help test! Where do I get the new build?

Thank you very much! This section is very detailed, so here's some quick links to your preferred platform:\
\
[Windows via SteamVR (OpenXR)](xr-framework-experimental-build.md#windows-via-steamvr-openxr)\
Oculus Rift\
Oculus Quest\
\
Already set up? Jump to:\

[How do I report bugs?](xr-framework-experimental-build.md#how-do-i-report-bugs)

#### Windows via SteamVR (OpenXR)

Our desktop build is now powered by OpenXR! To make it easy to access, we have added a new beta channel on Steam.

![Accessing Open Brush properties via Steam.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)

First, grab Open Brush from the Steam store. Once you have added it to your library, right click on the listing and choose 'Properties...'

![The beta unlocks!](<../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)

Select 'Betas' from the sidebar. In the text box, add the access code: **`openbrushxrbeta` ** and click 'Check Code'. A blue banner will appear below, confirming your access!

![Selecting the beta branch after opting in.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)

You can now access the openxr and openxr-experimental betas. select your desired beta from the dropdown and Steam will automatically install that version! The name of the game in your Steam library will be appended with \[openxr].

When you click Launch from within Steam, make sure to select 'Launch Open Brush in OpenXR Mode'!

### What should I be testing?

In short, everything you can! The previous SDKs were woven throughout the fabric of the app, so our changes impacted a lot of features. We have [prepared a list](https://github.com/icosa-gallery/open-brush/issues/249) over on our GitHub with suggestions of things to test (anything already ticked is assumed to be working).

### How do I report bugs?

If you are a GitHub user, please feel free to add a comment to our [Issue #245 ](https://github.com/icosa-gallery/open-brush/issues/249)where we are keeping track of validation.\
