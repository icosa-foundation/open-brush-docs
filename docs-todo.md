# Docs TODO

1. Better docs on using with 3rd party platform SDKs like AltSpace, VR Chat, Mona etc
2. Better docs on SDK/Toolkit especially with regard to Unity 2020 and URP/HDRP
3. Better docs on importing to Blender etc
4. Improve docs on video generally.
5. 3d model import needs a lot of work explaining the pitfalls - although fixing the importer would also solve this!
6. Make it clear in the docs when a feature is PC only. Especially stuff [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QQVGQr8PTWNBYWj1hiE807CBUgbhlD1gcsm25ZZKP7E)
7. Missing docs on new features [here](differences-between-open-brush-and-tilt-brush.md) and [here](release-history.md)
8. Investigate limits to model import complexity and document them
9. Document "Simplification" and check for other missing settings docs
10. Add a "Case Studies" page
11. user-guide/monoscopic-mode page - better download links ( use nightly.link )
