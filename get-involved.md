### Teachers, Academics, Researchers in any field

* Open Brush is fully open source. That makes us unique among creative VR apps - you can change how Open Brush works and tailor it to fit specific niche purposes.
* Open Brush is also a brilliant place for students to learn what it's like to contribute to a real-world open source project. Any of the roles mentioned elsewhere on this page could be valuable experience for students across a range of disciplines

* Come and talk to us. Either email or via the Discord. Let us know your ideas about using Open Brush in new ways.

* Can you believe there's people who don't know we're completely open source and volunteer-run?
* And they don't know about all the [cool stuff we've been doing](https://opencollective.com/icosa/updates/2021-retrospective-and-open-brush-1-0). Help us get the word out.

### Billionaires

Enough funding for a couple of full-time staff would make a vast difference. That's small change to you, right? :-)
