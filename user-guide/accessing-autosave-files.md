# Accessing Autosave Files

Open Brush regularly saves your work into your Documents/Open Brush/Sketches/Autosave folder. Each sketch you make has a separate autosave file, and Open Brush keeps autosaves from your last five sketches. If you need to access an autosave, move it into your Documents/Open Brush/Sketches folder using Windows Explorer—it will have an Open Brush logo as its thumbnail in the Sketchbook.
