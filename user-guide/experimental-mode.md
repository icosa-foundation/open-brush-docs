# Experimental Mode

## What is Experimental Mode?

{% hint style="info" %}
Some features that used to require experimental mode have been made part of normal mode. The only remaining difference in experimental mode is the brushes. There is also no longer a separate build for experimental mode but we do have some [experimental feature builds](../alternate-and-experimental-builds/) you can download.
{% endhint %}

Google had various stages for a new feature to make it's way into Tilt Brush. It would start off available only to a closed group of testers and developers. After that it might be added to the [Labs panel ](check-out-labs-or-experimental-features.md)in the official release. And finally it would be released as an officially supported feature.

When Tilt Brush was released as open source, we discovered all the features that had been previously available to a select few and we made these available for everyone to try.

### Turning on Experimental Mode

Simply open up the Settings Panel and click the button.

### Experimental Brushes

There are [50 new brushes](experimental-mode.md#experimental-brushes) - although some duplicate existing brushes and were included for technical reasons. That still leaves plenty of cool new brushes to play with. But be warned - they might not look correct when you export your sketches. Which is why they are still in "experimental mode" only.

### Compatibility Issues

The main thing to be aware of with "Experimental Mode" builds is the new brushes. Any sketch you save that contains these new brushes may not look correct when you export it to another piece of software or load it in a non-experimental version of Open Brush.

We are currently working on a new Unity Toolkit that has support for all the experimental brushes in conjunction with the [new glb export format](exporting-open-brush-sketches-to-other-apps/configuring-export.md#choosing-between-the-new-and-old-gltf-formats)
