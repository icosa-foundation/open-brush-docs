# Experimental Brushes

## Turning on Experimental Brushes

Simply open up the Settings Panel and click the button.

There are [50 new brushes](experimental-mode.md#experimental-brushes) - although some duplicate existing brushes and were included for technical reasons. That still leaves plenty of cool new brushes to play with. But be warned - they might not look correct when you export your sketches. Which is why they are still in "experimental mode" only.

### Compatibility Issues

Any sketch you save that contains these new brushes may not look correct when you export it to other Unity projects using the [Open Brush SDK](open-brush-unity-sdk.md)

We are currently working on a new Unity Toolkit that has support for all the experimental brushes in conjunction with the [new glb export format](exporting-open-brush-sketches-to-other-apps/configuring-export.md#choosing-between-the-new-and-old-gltf-formats)

## What was Experimental Mode?

{% hint style="info" %}
Some features that used to require experimental mode have been made part of normal mode. The only remaining difference in experimental mode is the brushes. There is also no longer a separate build for experimental mode but we do have some [experimental feature builds](../alternate-and-experimental-builds/) you can download.
{% endhint %}

Google had various stages for a new feature to make it's way into Tilt Brush. It would start off available only to a closed group of testers and developers. After that it might be added to the [Labs panel ](check-out-labs-or-experimental-features.md)in the official release. And finally it would be released as an officially supported feature.

We have merged all those features into the main version now - so there's no need for a separate experimental mode aside from activating the extra set of brushes.
