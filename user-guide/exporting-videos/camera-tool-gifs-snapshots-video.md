# Camera tool (GIFs, snapshots, video)

Open Brush has a handheld camera tool for quick captures. You use it for GIFs, snapshots, and (on PC VR) video.

### Where captures are saved

Videos and GIFs created with the Camera tool are saved to:

* `Documents/Open Brush/Videos`

### Beginner mode

In Beginner mode, the camera icon is a single-function tool. It opens camera controls on your brush controller.

The options are:

1. Auto-Gif
2. 5 Second Gif
3. Snapshot
4. Video (not present in some versions of Open Brush)

You control the camera like a handheld device.

* Swipe left/right on the thumbpad to switch modes.
* Pull the trigger to capture.

#### 5 Second Gif

Hold the trigger for five seconds. You can release and pull again to stop/start on the same 5-second timeline.

#### Video

Pull the trigger to start. Pull again to stop.

This is true handheld capture. You control camera direction, speed, and orientation.

### Advanced mode (Camera Options)

In Advanced mode, the camera icon has a sub-menu. You’ll see a small triangle in the corner.

Click and hold to open the sub-menu. Then choose **Camera Options**.
