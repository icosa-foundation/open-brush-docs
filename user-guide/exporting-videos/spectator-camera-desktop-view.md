# Spectator Camera (Desktop View)

The Spectator Camera does **not** record images or video. It outputs a view to your monitor.

To record it, use screen capture software. That software is outside Open Brush.

### Why you’d use it

It’s the only camera that can show:

* The full environment
* UI tools
* Camera paths

It’s also good for “stroke-by-stroke” creation footage.

### Modes

The Spectator Camera has four modes.

* **Headset**: The headset view. It moves with your head.
* **Stationary**: Place a camera in the scene. Or hold it like a handheld.
* **Figure 8**: A continuous figure-8 around a fixed point.
* **Circle**: A continuous horizontal orbit around a fixed point.

### Audio notes

Some audio sources can’t be captured due to DRM/DMCA restrictions. Spotify is a common example.

Your microphone recording is not affected.

### Strengths and limitations

Strengths:

* Easy, repeatable motion (Stationary/Figure 8/Circle).
* Shows controllers, headset, and tools.

Limitations:

* Requires external screen capture software.
* Field of view in **Camera Options** does **not** affect the Spectator Camera.
