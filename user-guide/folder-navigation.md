# Folder Navigation

The Folder Navigation UI allows you to organize and browse your imported media files (images, videos, and 3D models) in a hierarchical folder structure within Open Brush.

## What does it do?

Instead of displaying all your media files in a single flat list, the folder navigation system allows you to:

* Browse media files organized in folders and subfolders
* Navigate through directory hierarchies without leaving VR
* Keep your media library organized and manageable
* Quickly find specific assets by grouping them logically

## Where to find it

The folder navigation UI is part of the [Media Library](using-the-open-brush-tools-quick-tools-and-menu-panels/extras-panel/media-library.md) panel, accessible from:

1. Open the **Extras Panel** (click and hold the bottom icon on your palette)
2. Select **Media Library**
3. Navigate to **Local Images**, **Local Models**, or **Local Videos**

## How to organize your media

Your media files are stored in:

* **Images**: `Documents/Open Brush/Media Library/Images/`
* **Videos**: `Documents/Open Brush/Media Library/Videos/`
* **Models**: `Documents/Open Brush/Media Library/Models/`

You can create subfolders within these directories to organize your content. For example:

```
Documents/Open Brush/Media Library/Models/
├── Architecture/
│   ├── Buildings/
│   └── Furniture/
├── Nature/
│   ├── Trees/
│   └── Plants/
└── Characters/
```

## Using the folder navigator

When browsing your media library in VR:

* **Folder icons** - Click to open a folder and view its contents
* **Up/Back button** - Navigate to the parent folder
* **File icons** - Click to preview or place the media item in your sketch
* **Breadcrumb trail** - Shows your current location in the folder hierarchy (if available)

## Tips

* Keep folder names short and clear for easier reading in VR
* Use logical groupings that match your workflow
* Avoid nesting folders too deeply (3-4 levels maximum recommended)
* Regularly organize new imports into appropriate folders
