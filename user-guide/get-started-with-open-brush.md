# Get started with Open Brush

Paint in 3D with Open Brush, an app that runs on the [HTC Vive](http://www.htcvive.com/) , [Valve Index](https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex) , [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/) , [Oculus Quest](https://www.oculus.com/quest/), and [Windows Mixed Reality](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality) virtual reality systems. You can use different brushes, effects, and tools to paint your virtual creations.

### **Requirements and Installation**

To paint in 3D with Open Brush, you’ll need to have a VR headset that supports SteamVR or any Oculus headset.

**HTC Vive / Valve Index**

1. Set up your [HTC Vive](http://www.htc.com/managed-assets/shared/desktop/vive/Vive\_PRE\_User\_Guide.pdf) or [Valve Index](https://support.steampowered.com/kb\_article.php?ref=9140-EYIL-0086).
2. If you haven't already, [install Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/).
3. Download the [Open Brush](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1634870/Open\_Brush/) app.
4. To open Open Brush, open the Steam Library > select **Games** > **Open Brush**.

The system requirements for running Open Brush are the same system requirements for the [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive/category\_howto/system-requirements.html) and [Valve Index](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070910/Are\_you\_ready\_for\_Valve\_Index/).

**Oculus Rift**

Rift users can either use the SteamVR build as described above for the HTC Vive / Valve Index, or the Rift-specific build described here:

1. Set up your [Oculus Rift](https://www3.oculus.com/en-us/setup/).
2. Download the [Open Brush](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/5227489953989768/) app.
3. To open Open Brush, open the **Oculus Home Library** > **Open Brush.**

The system requirements for running Open Brush are the same system requirements for the [Oculus Rift](https://www3.oculus.com/en-us/oculus-ready-pcs/).

**Oculus Quest**

Oculus Quests can either be used standalone or tethered to a PC. For tethered ("PCVR" mode), see the instructions above for the SteamVR build for HTC Vive / Valve index. For standalone mode (which has some performance limitations compared to being connected to a PC), follow these instructions:

1. Set up your [Oculus Quest](https://www.oculus.com/setup/#quest-setup).
2. Download the [Open Brush](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3600360710032222/) app, currently on App Lab.
3. To open Open Brush, open the **Oculus Home Library** > **Open Brush.**

**Windows Mixed Reality**

1. Set up your [Windows Mixed Reality headset](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4043101/windows-10-set-up-windows-mixed-reality).
2. If you haven't already, [install Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/).
3. Download the [Open Brush](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1634870/Open\_Brush/) app.
4. To open Open Brush, open the Steam Library > select **Games** > **Open Brush**.

The system requirements for running Open Brush are the same system requirements for the [Windows Mixed Reality headsets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines).

### **For a quick tutorial**

1. Make sure you are in [Advanced Mode](https://support.google.com/tiltbrush/answer/6389712?hl=en\&ref\_topic=7074683).
2. On your palette, go to **Tools >** **More** > **Tips ‘N Tricks.**
3. This will run you through an overview of your Open Brush controllers and where the various buttons are.

Note that left handed users can switch the left and right controllers by tapping (gently!) the base of the two controllers together, so that the left hand controller will paint and the right hand controller will contain the various panels and settings. You can also swap left and right hands in the [Settings Panel](using-the-open-brush-tools-quick-tools-and-menu-panels/settings.md)

### **View sketches**

When you run Open Brush for the very first time, you'll be shown an introductory tutorial teaching you how to paint and use the palette.

Every time the app is started after that initial run, your palette hand will by default open to the Sketchbook. In the Sketchbook, you can choose between viewing some featured sketches by the community and your own saved sketches. You can also choose to start a new sketch.
