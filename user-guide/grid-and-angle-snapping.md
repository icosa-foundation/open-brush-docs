1. Snap selections to a grid. Duplicate selections at precise positions
2. Draw brush strokes that align with the grid (especially useful with the hull brush)
3. Snap the rotation of selections to a chosen angle (i.e. 15, 45 or 90 degrees)

### What's it good for?

Drawing along straight x, y or z lines. Building regular structures up by making multiple copies of brush strokes
