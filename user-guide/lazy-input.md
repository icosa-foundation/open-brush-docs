# Lazy Input

VR controllers can sometimes be a little too accurate and responsive, making it difficult to create smooth curves at low movement speeds. The Lazy Input feature will exchange responsiveness for control by applying real-time input smoothing.

Toggle it by HOLDING your off-hand trigger and TAPPING the button marked with the rabbit/turtle.
