## Platform-Specific Features

### Passthrough Hull Brush

On headsets that support passthrough (Meta Quest, Pico), you can use the Passthrough Hull Brush to paint with passthrough effects. This brush shows the real world through your painted strokes, creating mixed reality effects.

To use it:
1. Enable passthrough mode in your headset settings or Open Brush
2. Select the Hull brush or compatible brush
3. Look for passthrough options in the brush settings

This allows you to blend your VR creations with the real world, creating unique mixed reality artwork.

### Oculus MRC Fixes

Mixed Reality Capture (MRC) on Oculus/Meta headsets has been improved with various bug fixes, allowing better quality recordings of yourself interacting with your Open Brush sketches for streaming and content creation.

## Precise Slider Control

On all platforms, you can use the thumbstick for fine control when adjusting sliders:

- **Normal movement**: Swipe or move the thumbstick for regular slider adjustment
- **Precise control**: Hold the thumbstick in position for slower, more precise adjustments
- Works on brush size, color values, and all other slider controls

This is particularly useful for:
- Fine-tuning exact color values
- Setting precise brush sizes
- Adjusting settings that need careful calibration
