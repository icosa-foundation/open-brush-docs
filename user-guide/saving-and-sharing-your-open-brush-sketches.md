# Saving and sharing your Open Brush sketches

When you are finished with your 3D creation, you can save your Open Brush sketch to your computer, or share it to [Icosa](https://beta.icosa.gallery/) or [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com). You can also take snapshot, GIFs or videos of your art to send to friends or post online.

### **Saving a sketch**

While painting, you can save your sketch to avoid losing changes.

1. Navigate to the Tools panel in the palette, and select the **Save** icon: ![](../.gitbook/assets/image-134.png)
2. Take a snapshot of your sketch to use as a thumbnail image.
3. Your sketch is now added to your Sketchbook.
4. Your sketch file is saved to your computer at **Documents/Open Brush/Sketches**.

You can rename your sketches using the [XR Keyboard](xr-keyboard.md) when browsing them in the Sketchbook.

You can also combine multiple sketches into one. See [Merging Sketches](merging-sketches.md) for more information.

### **Trouble saving sketches**

If you're having issues saving your sketch, check that you have administration privileges on your machine. Antivirus software can also sometimes interfere with the ability to save sketches.

### **Sharing your Open Brush sketches**

To share your creations outside of Open Brush, click **Upload** ![](../.gitbook/assets/image-135.png) to publish your sketch to [Icosa](https://beta.icosa.gallery/). Once you have published your sketch, you can share the link to your sketch on social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.

## Icosa Gallery Integration

Open Brush has built-in integration with [Icosa Gallery](https://icosa.gallery), allowing you to:

### Browse and Load Sketches

From within Open Brush, you can browse the Icosa Gallery and load sample sketches directly into VR:
1. Open the sketch browser
2. Navigate to the Icosa Gallery tab
3. Browse featured and popular sketches

This is a great way to:
- Explore what other artists have created
