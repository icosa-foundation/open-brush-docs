# Selection/Erase Filter

If you hold down your Wand trigger (the left hand if you're using Open Brush right-handed) when you first select a stroke with the Selection Tool, only brushstrokes that use that brush will be added to the selection as you continue to select strokes.

You only have to be careful with the first stroke you select, and then after that, you can just wave the selection or erase tools with reckless abandon and it will only select strokes using the same brush type.
