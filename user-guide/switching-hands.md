# Switching Hands

Open Brush allows you to swap which hand you use for painting and which hand you use for accessing menus and tools. This feature is useful for left-handed users or anyone who wants to change their preferred hand during a session.

## What does it do?

By default, Open Brush assigns:

* **Right hand** (or dominant hand) - Painting brush and color palette
* **Left hand** (or non-dominant hand) - Menu panel and tools

The "Swap Hands" or "Switch Hands" feature reverses these assignments, allowing you to:

* Paint with your left hand instead of your right
* Access menus with your right hand instead of your left
* Quickly experiment with different hand configurations
* Switch hands mid-session if one hand gets tired

## How to switch hands

### Using the Settings Panel

1. Open the **Admin Panel** (press the menu button or equivalent on your controller)
2. Select **Settings** to open the Settings Panel
3. Click the **Swap Hands** button

The change takes effect immediately. Your controllers will now have swapped roles.

### What changes when you switch hands

After swapping hands:

* The **brush and palette** move to the other controller
* The **menu panel and tools** move to the other controller
* All painting is now done with the opposite hand
* Menu navigation uses the opposite hand

### What stays the same

* Controller button mappings remain the same (trigger still paints, etc.)
* Your existing sketch is unaffected
* Saved preferences and settings are preserved

## Tips

* **Try both configurations** - Some artists find they have better control with one configuration or the other
* **Switch for specific tasks** - You might prefer one hand for broad strokes and another for detail work
* **Ambidextrous workflow** - Practice with both hands to reduce fatigue during long sessions
* **Remember to switch back** - If you're left-handed, you may need to swap hands each time you start Open Brush

## Persistent setting

The hand preference is saved with your Open Brush settings, so:

* Your choice persists between sessions
* You don't need to swap every time you launch the app
* Each user profile can have its own preference (if using multiple accounts)

## Accessibility

This feature is particularly important for:

* **Left-handed users** - Ensures comfortable use regardless of hand dominance
* **Users with limited mobility** - Allows using the hand with better mobility for painting
* **Injury recovery** - Switch hands if one hand is injured or fatigued
* **Teaching and demonstrations** - Instructors can match their hand orientation to students
