* Removed h265 support.

## Accessing Autosave Files

Tilt Brush regularly saves your work into your Documents/Tilt Brush/Sketches/Autosave folder. Each sketch you make has a separate autosave file, and Tilt Brush keeps autosaves from your last five sketches. If you need to access an autosave, move it into your Documents/Tilt Brush/Sketches folder using Windows Explorer—it will have a Tilt Brush logo as its thumbnail in the Sketchbook.

## ~~Tilt Brush Config File~~

Outdated See [Open Brush Config File](the-open-brush-config-file.md)

## Exporting Tilt Brush Sketches

Tilt Brush sketches can be exported by clicking the ‘Export’ button found on the Labs panel. The Labs panel can be found under ‘More…’ on the Tools panel.

Each sketch exported from Tilt Brush creates a separate folder in **Documents/Tilt Brush/Exports** which contains the geometry in the following formats:

* .glb (binary glTF version 2)
* .fbx (Desktop only)
* .usd (Desktop only)
* .json (Desktop only)

The .json is a “raw” format which you can use if you need a different file format. See the [Tilt Brush Toolkit](https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush-toolkit) for sample [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) scripts that convert the raw .json to .obj.

python convert\_to\_fbx.py "c:\Users\\_username_\Documents\Tilt Brush\Exports\Untitled\_1.json"

Each script has a set of command-line options that fine-tune the generated file.

The USD contains both geometry and curve information. If your DCC tool doesn’t support USD, the [Tilt Brush Toolkit](https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush-toolkit) contains a Python 2.7 script that can convert the .tilt file to a Collada .dae containing the curves.

#### Maya

After importing the FBX file into Maya you will need to turn off the _Alpha is Luminance_ attribute in the _Color Balance_ section for each texture node. To see the brush colors in the viewport turn on the _Display Colors_ attribute and set _Material Blend_ to Multiply in the _Mesh Component Display_ section on each mesh shape node.

To render with the vertex colors you can use the mentalrayVertexColors shader node to access the stroke color in your material.

#### Sketchfab

To post to Sketchfab you will need to upload the FBX file and the textures.

We are working with Sketchfab to have Tilt Brush import correctly, but if the strokes look wrong you can try opening the 3D Settings Editor in Sketchfab and under the Materials tab set the material properties manually.

#### Unity

We recommend using the Tilt Brush Toolkit and the .glb format. Tilt Brush Toolkit also understands the .fbx format.

#### Command-line Exporting

To export sketches from the command line, use the --export option to specify a file or set of files to export. --export supports wildcards, and multiple files can be specified with a single --export flag. Filenames without a path are assumed to be found in the Tilt Brush Sketches directory.

You can override the destination folder of exports using the --exportPath flag.

We suggest you also specify the -batchmode option if you don’t want the Tilt Brush window to appear.

```
TiltBrush.exe --export Untitled_15.tilt Untitled_2*.tilt C:\Downloads\downloaded.tilt --exportPath C:\Temp -batchmode
```

## Exporting Video

### Rendering ‘Offline’ videos

When you create a video from inside Tilt Brush using the Camera tool, Tilt Brush will create a Windows batch file alongside the video (In Documents\Tilt Brush\Videos) that you can run to re-render the video at a higher resolution. For example:

_Untitled\_13\_00.mp4_

_Untitled\_13\_00.HQ\_Render.bat_

Double-clicking the ".bat" batch file will give you several options for re-rendering your video:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/1 (1).png>)

Press the number corresponding to the format you prefer. It will then launch Tilt Brush, which will reload your sketch and render the video. Once it is done, Tilt Brush will exit. As rendering at higher quality tends to affect the framerate, it is suggested that you do not wear your headset until this process completes.

“No Quick Load” option (#6) will forego quick loading of the sketch and will force it to load at normal speed. It is recommended that the time spent recording should exceed the normal loading time of the sketch or else the video may end before the sketch completes loading.

### Video Camera Paths

Rendering offline videos is achieved by saving off the path the camera took when the video was taken, and then re-using that to recreate the video. The camera path is saved off in ASCII USD ([Universal Scene Description](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html)) format, so if you have an application that can read and write USD, you may be able to use it to edit camera paths. Camera paths can also be combined with USD exports from Tilt Brush, to exactly recreate how the camera moved through the scene.

If you want to render a camera path from the command line directly, rather than using the batch file detailed above, you can use the following:

```
Tiltbrush.exe --renderCameraPath <path/to/camerpath.usda> <path/to/sketchfile.tilt>
```

### Changing Eye Scale on ODS 360 videos

When you render an ODS video, you may find things like the floor is missing, or parts of your objects get clipped off.

The reason this happens is that it’s often easier to scale down your sketch to make it easy to move the camera when you take your original video, but when you render out an ODS file, the objects are too close to the camera.

To fix this, you can change a value in the .usda file. Open it up in your favorite text editor and look at around line 30 for:

```
uniform float eyeScale = 1
```

If you reduce this value, the render will feel bigger, and the camera is less likely to clip with parts of your sketch. A good value to try out is:

```
uniform float eyeScale = 0.1
```

Then you can just try re-rendering with the batch file.

### Exporting 360 videos / Offline Video Rendering

Videos can be rendered ‘offline’ faster and at a much higher resolution and framerate than using the internal Multicam tool

1. **Editing Tilt Brush cfg file**
2. Go to C:\Documents\Tilt Brush\Tilt Brush cfg
3. Under "Video" add the flag "SaveCameraPath": true,
4. Save Tilt Brush cfg
5. **Camera Setup**
6. Load the sketch you would like to render
7. Find a good spot from which you would like to capture your 360 video
8. Be sure to look around in all directions to make sure no objects are too close to the point of capture
9. Save your sketch
10. Record your video by moving camera or keeping camera stationary
11. After saving, exit Tilt Brush
12. **Rendering**\
    \*\*\*\*Note: When you create a video from inside Tilt Brush using the Camera tool with configuration "SaveCameraPath" flag set to _true_, Tilt Brush will create a Windows batch file alongside the video (In Documents\Tilt Brush\Videos) that you can run to re-render the video at a higher resolution
13. Go to C:\Documents\Tilt Brush\Videos . There should be .usda, .bat and video file which corresponds to the .tilt file
14. Double click on .bat file
15. If you run that batch file a command window will appear giving you several options for re-rendering your video:![](<../.gitbook/assets/2 (1).png>)Press a number to get whichever format you prefer. It will then launch Tilt Brush, which will reload your sketch, and re-render the video. Once it is done, Tilt Brush will exit. As rendering at higher quality tends to affect the framerate, it is suggested that you do not wear your headset while this process completes.
16. Once the render is complete, it will pop open the “VRVideos” folder which should contain an video file with your stereo render.
17. **Converting into 360 video** 1. [Download the 360° Video Metadata app](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631?hl=en) for [Mac](https://github.com/google/spatial-media/releases/download/v2.0/360.Video.Metadata.Tool.mac.zip) or [Windows](https://github.com/google/spatial-media/releases/tag/v2.0). The dialog should look like this:![](<../.gitbook/assets/3 (1).png>) 2. Un-zip the file, then open the 360 Video Metadata app. If you're on a Mac, you may need to right-click the app and then click Open. 3. Select the video file. 4. Select the checkbox for My Video is stereoscopic 3D (top/bottom layout) 5. Click Inject Metadata 6. Enter a name for the file that will be created. 7. Save the file. A new file will be created automatically in the same location as the original file.
18. **Uploading to Youtube**
    1. Upload the new “injected” video file to YouTube
    2. Note that it takes YouTube some additional time to process 360 videos, until this process is finished, you may see the raw over/under and the “View in Cardboard” option will not be available.
    3. Once processing is done, you should see this icon when viewing the video on your phone, indicating that it’s ready to be viewed in VR:

## Tilt Brush Unity Shader Examples

Use these with geometry you export from Tilt Brush and import into Unity. However, you should prefer to use the [Tilt Brush Toolkit](http://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush-toolkit), which comes with Tilt Brush shaders.

#### Opaque shader

```
Shader "Brush/Standard"
{
    Properties
    {
        _Color ("Main Color", Color) = (1,1,1,1)
        _SpecColor ("Specular Color", Color) = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0)
        _Shininess ("Shininess", Range (0.01, 1)) = 0.078125
        _MainTex ("Base (RGBA)", 2D) = "white" {}
        _BumpMap ("Normalmap", 2D) = "bump" {}
        _Cutoff ("Alpha cutoff", Range(0,1)) = 0.5
    }
    SubShader
    {
        Tags
        {
            "Queue"="AlphaTest" "IgnoreProjector"="True" "RenderType"="TransparentCutout"
        }
        LOD 400
        CGPROGRAM

        struct Input
        {
            float2 uv_MainTex;
            float2 uv_BumpMap;
            float4 color : Color;
        };

        sampler2D _MainTex;
        sampler2D _BumpMap;
        fixed4 _Color;
        half _Shininess;

        void vert(inout appdata_full i)
        {
        }

        void surf(Input IN, inout SurfaceOutputStandardSpecular o)
        {
            fixed4 tex = tex2D(_MainTex, IN.uv_MainTex);
            o.Albedo = tex.rgb * _Color.rgb * IN.color.rgb;
            o.Smoothness = _Shininess;
            o.Specular = _SpecColor;
            o.Normal = UnpackNormal(tex2D(_BumpMap, IN.uv_BumpMap));
            o.Alpha = tex.a * IN.color.a;
        }
        ENDCG
    }
    FallBack "Transparent/Cutout/VertexLit"
}
```

#### Additive shader

```
Shader "Brush/Additive"

    Properties
    {
        _MainTex ("Texture", 2D) = "white" {}
    }

        }
        SubShader
        {
            Pass
            {
                CGPROGRAM
                #pragma vertex vert
                #pragma fragment frag
                #include "UnityCG.cginc"
                sampler2D _MainTex;

                struct appdata_t
                {
                    float4 vertex : POSITION;
                    fixed4 color : COLOR;
                    float3 normal : NORMAL;
                    float2 texcoord : TEXCOORD0;
                };

                struct v2f
                {
                    float4 vertex : POSITION;
                    fixed4 color : COLOR;
                    float2 texcoord : TEXCOORD0;
                };

                float4 _MainTex_ST;

                v2f vert(appdata_t v)
                {
                    v2f o;
                    o.vertex = mul(UNITY_MATRIX_MVP, v.vertex);
                    o.texcoord = TRANSFORM_TEX(v.texcoord, _MainTex);
                    o.color = v.color;
                    return o;
                }

                fixed4 frag(v2f i) : COLOR
                {
                    half4 c = tex2D(_MainTex, i.texcoord);
                    return i.color * c;
                }
                ENDCG
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Tilt Brush File Format

The .tilt file format can also be parsed by the [Tilt Brush Toolkit](http://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush-toolkit).

A .tilt is a zip-format file with a prepended header:

```
uint32 sentinel ('tilT')
uint16 header_size (currently 16)
uint16 header_version (currently 1)
uint32 reserved
uint32 reserved
```

Inside the zip, the strokes are stored in a custom binary format in a file, "data.sketch":

```
uint32 sentinel
uint32 version
uint32 reserved (must be 0)
[ uint32 size + <size> bytes of additional header data ]
int32 num_strokes
num_strokes * {
    int32 brush_index
    float32x4 brush_color
    float32 brush_size
    uint32 stroke_extension_mask
    uint32 controlpoint_extension_mask
    [ int32/float32 for each set bit in stroke_extension_mask & ffff ]
    [ uint32 size + <size> bytes for each set bit in stroke_extension_mask & ~ffff ]
    int32 num_control_points
    num_control_points * {
        float32x3 position
        float32x4 orientation (quat)
        [ int32/float32 for each set bit in controlpoint_extension_mask ]
    }
}
```

The orientation is that of the controller. Curve and surface frames must be reconstructed.

Stroke extensions:

| 0 | <p>uint32 bitfield.<br>Bit 0: IsGroupContinue</p> |
| - | ------------------------------------------------- |

Control point extensions:

| 0 | float pressure, in \[0,1]         |
| - | --------------------------------- |
| 1 | uint32 timestamp, in milliseconds |

###

Also inside the zip is "metadata.json", the metadata for the sketch in json format. Here are some of the fields that can be found there:

* "Authors": an array of author names.
* "SceneTransformInRoomSpace": the transform of the scene relative to the room.
* "ThumbnailCameraTransformInRoomSpace": the transform used to generate the sketch as an array of:
  * translation (array of 3 floats)
  * rotation quaternion (array of 4 floats)
  * scale (single float)
* "ModelIndex": an array of models imported into the sketch. Each model can have the following:
  * "FilePath": location of the model
  * "PinStates": an array to indicate whether each instance of the model should initially be pinned.
  * "RawTransforms": an array of transforms for each instance of the model.

## Previous Releases

#### Version 22

* Added Groups to Selection tool.
  * Grouping allows brush strokes and widgets to share selection state. Select part of a group and the whole group is selected with it.
  * Grouping status data is saved with the sketch.
  * When a sketch is exported, each group is written to a separate node in the exported file. This allows easier sketch manipulation in editing tools, post-export.
  * “Group Selection” is one of the buttons available on the new selection tray that pops out next to the selection button when the selection tool is on.
* Added Reference Videos support.
  * New tab added to Media Library Panel for videos.
  * Videos are taken from the **Tilt Brush\Media Library\Videos** directory.
  * Videos, like reference images, are not stored in the .tilt file and are not uploaded to Poly.
  * You can link to an online video by putting its URL into a .txt file inside the videos directory.
  * Audio from videos is supported, but is ‘2D’ only.
  * Known bugs:
    * Reference Videos do not currently work in offline renders.
* Export Improvements.
  * Tilt Brush exports .glb (glTF 2.0) instead of .glb1 (glTF 1.1). glTF 2.0 is supported by more tools and is slightly more efficient.
  * Export now works on Oculus Quest (.glb only)
  * [Tilt Brush Toolkit](https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush-toolkit) supports both .glb and .glb1.
  * **glb**: Added timing information to .glb exports.
    * Tilt Brush Toolkit will put timing information into texcoord2.
    * Timestamps are a vec3.
      * x,y = the earliest/latest timestamp in the stroke which contains that vertex.
      * z = the timestamp for that vertex.
    * This can be disabled in the Tilt Brush config Export section with “ExportStrokeTimestamp”: false
    * [How to use the Tilt Brush config file.](broken-reference/)
  * **glb, fbx**: Media Library models are now included in exports.
  * **glb, fbx**: Various quality of life improvements in the exported file.
* New tool tip descriptions.
  * Tool tips have a new cleaner and consistent look.
* Deterministic Geometry Generation.
  * Some stroke behavior is randomized—for example, brush textures and Light Wire light colors. This behavior is now saved into the .tilt, so when you re-load a sketch you will see the same thing as when you drew it.

#### Version 21

* Quest release only.
* Added Labs Panel.
  * Contains Reference Image Panel, Pin Tool, Export, and experimental Cameras.
* Added Reference Image support.
  * Requires connecting your Quest to a PC and side loading images into a Tilt Brush folder. Some restrictions apply.
  * See the [Help Center](https://support.google.com/tiltbrush/answer/9427219?hl=en\&ref\_topic=7074683) for a more detailed explanation of how to use Reference Images.
* Added Export to .glb1 (binary glTF).
  * Updated Tilt Brush Toolkit to support .glb1 import.
  * Previously, Reference Images would appear in the export as as empty transform nodes. They are now included in the export.
* Added Cameras.
  * Experimental version of Snapshot and Gif Capture cameras.
* Tilt Brush files moved to “/sdcard/Tilt Brush” on Quest.

  * If you want to move your selection, grab it as you would any other model in your scene. To delete a selected group of strokes, just throw it away.
  * Duplicate selections by holding the thumbpad (Vive) or “A/X” button (Rift) while intersecting your controller with selected strokes.
* Quick Tool:
  * Holding the “menu” button (Vive) or “Y/B” (Rift) on the controller now triggers a “Quick Tool” menu, letting you quickly swap tools without reaching back to the palette.
* Palette icon reorganization:
  * Reshuffled icons on the palette, based on common usage patterns
  * Moved the user profile button to the Menu Panel
  * Introduced a new “More…” menu where we’re moving more advanced tools and features.
  * We did not remove any Tools - if you’re looking for something and can’t find it, it is probably either in a “More…” menu or under “Labs.”
* Relaxed limit on model scale:
  * Imported models can be scaled to much smaller and larger sizes.
  * At certain large scales you may find performance hitches -- your fate is in your hands.
* Fixed duplicate upload bug:
  * Now when you upload sketches to vr.google.com/sketches, new drafts of a sketch will overwrite the last draft (instead of creating a new one).
  * Doesn’t affect published sketches.

  * _Caution!_ Extra large images, such as 4k, may cause performance hitches in Tilt Brush.
* Export
  * Exports current scene's metadata and 3D geometry to a json file in **Documents/Tilt Brush/Exports**.
  * Tilt Brush ships with sample [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) scripts to convert the .json to .obj and .fbx formats. These scripts are in the **Support/bin** folder, which is next to TiltBrush.exe. The fbx conversion also requires the [Autodesk FBX Python SDK](http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/fbx20151\_fbxpythonsdk\_win.exe). To find TiltBrush.exe from Steam, right-click "Tilt Brush" → Properties → Local Files → Browse Local Files...
  *   Example script usage:

      python convert\_to\_fbx.py "c:\Users\\_username_\Documents\Tilt Brush\Exports\Untitled\_1.json"

      Each script has a set of command-line options that fine-tune the generated file.
  * Note that this initial preview **does not export textures or materials**. In addition, the .obj file format does not support vertex colors. We’re looking into solutions to provide users with more of this data, but didn’t want to delay sharing what we have now. The .fbx does support vertex colors, but to see them you will need to apply a shader that uses vertex color information like the two example Unity shaders below.
  * Please [let us know](mailto:tiltbrush@google.com?Subject=I%20used%20export) how you use this functionality!
* IRC
  * Requires “Tilt Brush.cfg”, stored in: **Documents/Tilt Brush**
  * Format:

```
{
   "IRC":{
      "ServerName":"irc.twitch.tv",
      "ServerPort":6667,
      "Username":"TiltBrushStreamer",
      "OAuth":"oauth:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123",
      "Channel":"#tiltbrushchannel"
   }
}
```
