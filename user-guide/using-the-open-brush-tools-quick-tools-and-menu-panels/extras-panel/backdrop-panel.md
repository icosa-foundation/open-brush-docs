Use Backdrop to modify your scene's backdrop color gradient and fog.

* Grab anywhere on the backdrop sphere to move or turn it by selecting with the trigger
* The backdrop sphere represents the sky dome (skybox) in the world.
* Change the backdrop gradient by selecting different colors.
* Change the fog intensity by adjusting the slider, and you can change the color by clicking on the fog rectangle.
* Reset your environment at any time by reloading it from the environment panel.
* Custom environments save with sketches
* Some environments already have textured sky dome. In that case, you will be prompted to turn off that custom skybox before you can modify it.
