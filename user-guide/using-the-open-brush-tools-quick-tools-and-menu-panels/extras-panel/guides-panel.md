## Guide Types

Open Brush includes several types of guides:

### Plane Guide

The plane guide creates a flat surface that you can paint on or use as a reference. This is useful for:
- Creating flat surfaces like floors, walls, or tables
- Drawing 2D elements in 3D space
- Aligning objects to a common plane
- Building architectural elements

### Other Guides

- **Sphere guide** - Paint on a spherical surface
- **Cube guide** - Paint along box edges and faces
- **Capsule (pill) guide** - Paint on cylindrical surfaces with rounded ends
