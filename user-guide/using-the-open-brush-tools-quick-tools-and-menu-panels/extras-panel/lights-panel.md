Use Lights to modify your scene's primary and secondary lighting colors and positioning.

* The sun is your primary light, and it casts shadows.
* The sun is the brighter light.
* The moon is your secondary light, it doesnâ€™t cast shadows.
* The fill light floods the scene with an equal distribution of color and light. It's effects are most easily seen in the shadow color of your scene.
* You can grab and move the sun and moon by selecting with the trigger.
* You can change the color of all three light sources.
* The lighting effect is best observed on environments with a ground and object (i.e. pedestal), and in those sketches where there are at least a few strokes.
* The sphere the lights pivot around can be used as a representation/quick preview for placement of lights in the world.
* Custom lights save with sketches.
