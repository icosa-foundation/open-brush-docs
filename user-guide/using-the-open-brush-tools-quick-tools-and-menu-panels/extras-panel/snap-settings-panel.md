The Snap Settings Panel provides controls for grid and angle snapping. For basic usage, see [Grid and Angle Snapping](../../grid-and-angle-snapping.md).

## Enhanced Snap Settings

The snap settings include several advanced features:

### Snap Axis Toggles

You can choose which axes snapping applies to. For example:
- Enable only Y-axis snapping to keep strokes at consistent heights while allowing free movement in X and Z
- Enable only X and Z to create a flat plane of snapped objects
- Enable all three axes for full 3D grid snapping

This is useful for creating rows, columns, or planes of duplicated objects while maintaining precise control over which dimensions are constrained.

### Snap to Guides

When you have guides active in your scene, you can enable snapping to align selections and brush strokes to guide surfaces. This works with:
- Plane guides
- Sphere guides
- Line guides
- Mirror planes

This makes it easier to paint directly on guide surfaces or position imported models precisely on guides.
