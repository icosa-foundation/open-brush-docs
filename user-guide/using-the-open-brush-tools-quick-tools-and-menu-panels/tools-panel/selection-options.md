# Selection Options

The Selection tool has various options for selecting strokes and objects in your sketch.

## Selection Tools on Quest/Standalone VR

Quest and other standalone VR devices now have access to the full range of selection tools that were previously only available on PC VR:

### Select All

Selects every stroke, image, video, and 3D model in your current sketch. This is useful for:
- Applying transformations to your entire sketch
- Moving or scaling everything at once
- Changing colors or brushes across all strokes

### Invert Selection

Inverts your current selection - everything that was selected becomes unselected, and everything unselected becomes selected. This is useful for:
- Selecting everything except specific elements
- Quick operations like "select everything but this"

**Performance Note:** On complex sketches with many strokes, these operations may cause temporary stuttering or lag on standalone devices. Use them carefully in very large sketches.

## Move Selection to Layer

You can move selected strokes to a specific layer using the layer controls. This helps organize your sketch by grouping related elements together.

## Erase Media Widgets

The erase tool can now delete imported media (images, videos, and 3D models) in addition to brush strokes. Simply activate the eraser and touch any media widget to remove it from your sketch. This provides a faster alternative to using the grip button flick gesture to delete widgets.
