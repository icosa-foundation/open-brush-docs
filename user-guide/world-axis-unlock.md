# World Axis Unlock / View Axis Unlocking

Warning, not for the easily nauseated! While holding both grab buttons to change the scale, you'll see a padlock on one of the action buttons. Click it, and you'll now be able to orientate the world to any position you want!

This feature unlocks the view axis, allowing you to rotate your entire sketch independently of the VR world's orientation. This is particularly useful for:
- Working on different sides of a sketch without moving yourself
- Creating artwork at unusual angles
- Comfortable painting positions regardless of the sketch's orientation
