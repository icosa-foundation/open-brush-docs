# XR Keyboard

The XR Keyboard is a built-in virtual keyboard that allows you to enter text while in VR without needing to remove your headset or use external input devices.

## What does it do?

The XR Keyboard provides an in-VR text input method for naming sketches, renaming layers, and other text entry tasks within Open Brush.

## Where is it used?

The keyboard automatically appears when you need to enter text, such as:

* Renaming sketches in the sketch browser
* Naming layers in the Layers Panel
* Entering room names for multiplayer sessions
* Any other text input fields in Open Brush

## How do I use it?

When a text input field is activated, the XR Keyboard will appear in front of you. You can:

1. **Point and click** - Use your controller to point at keys and press the trigger to type
2. **Navigate** - Use the thumbstick or touchpad to move between keys
3. **Special keys** - The keyboard includes:
   * Backspace/Delete for corrections
   * Shift for capital letters
   * Space bar
   * Enter/Submit to confirm your input
   * Cancel to dismiss without saving changes

## Language Support

The XR Keyboard supports multiple languages based on your Open Brush language settings. See [Multiple Language Support](../release-history/v2.4-prismatic.md#multiple-language-support) for available languages.

## Tips

* The keyboard stays visible until you submit or cancel your input
* You can reposition the keyboard by grabbing it with the grip button (if supported)
* For longer text entry, you can also use the [Open Brush API](open-brush-api/) to send text from an external device
